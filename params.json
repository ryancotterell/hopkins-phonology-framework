{"name":"The Hopkins Phonology Framework","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to the Hopkins Phonology Framework.\r\nThe Hopkins Phonology Framework provides a toolkit for building \r\nstring-valued graphical models for modeling phonology and inferring underlying forms\r\nof words. The framework is build on OpenFST and provides an implementation of several \r\ninference algorithms as well as pre-built models. We also release datasets\r\nwe adapted from exercises in phonology textbooks. \r\n\r\n### Code\r\nComing Soon!\r\n\r\n### Datasets\r\nComing Soon!\r\n\r\n### Phonological Features\r\nComing Soon!\r\n\r\n###  Publications\r\n* Ryan Cotterell, Nanyun Peng, and Jason Eisner.
