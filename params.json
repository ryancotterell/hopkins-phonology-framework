{"name":"The Hopkins Phonology Framework","tagline":"","body":"## Welcome to the Hopkins Phonology Framework.\r\nThe Hopkins Phonology Framework provides a toolkit for building \r\nstring-valued graphical models for modeling phonology and inferring underlying forms\r\nof words. The framework is built on OpenFST and offers an implementation of several \r\ninference algorithms as well as pre-built models. We also release datasets\r\nwe adapted from exercises in phonology textbooks. \r\n\r\n## Code\r\n### Prerequisites\r\nI've augmented the [pyfst](http://pyfst.github.io/api.html) library by Victor Chahuneau with \r\nsome additional features. I added Cython headers to avoid going through Python, first\r\norder expectation semirings, signed log space, graph search for expected _n_-gram count extraction\r\nand a few other minor things. I plan to wrap the [OpenGRM](http://www.opengrm.org/) library as well as the [push-down transducer](http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/FstExtensions#FstPdts) extension in the near future.\r\n\r\n1. install [OpenFST 1.4.1](http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/FstDownload) \r\n2. pip install cython\r\n3. git checkout https://github.com/ryancotterell/hopkins-phonology-framework.git\r\n4. install [mustache](http://mustache.github.io/)\r\n5. cd pyfst\r\n6. make\r\n\r\n### Hopkins Phonology Framework\r\nComing Soon!\r\n## Datasets\r\n* [English Plurals](https://github.com/ryancotterell/hopkins-phonology-framework/blob/master/data/phonological_datasets/english_plurals) (100 word forms) \r\n* More Coming Soon!\r\n\r\n## Phonological Features\r\nComing Soon!\r\n\r\n##  Publications\r\n* Ryan Cotterell, Nanyun Peng, and Jason Eisner.
